EYE MOVEMENT PROJECT

The Eye Movement Project started with one eye on the screen that follows the mouse. A second eye needed to be created that follows the mouse as well and is in sync with the first eye. There are no images in this project and the eyes were created using css.

HOW TO USE
To use the Eye Movement Project, open up the page and move your mouse! Watch the "pupils" of the eye follow your mouse around the webpage.

Roadmap
The roadmap for this project includes updating the eyes to a bit more expressive by adding eyelashes, eybrows, and a mouth.
