BUS TRACKER PROJECT 
The Bus Tracker Project shows the route of the MBTA between Harvard and MIT. There is a blue icon that appears every second on the web page to show you exactly where the bus stop is. 

HOW TO USE
To start the bus tracker, click the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button. Once you click the button, you will see the button appear and be able to follow along with the bus route. 

ROADMAP
Update the map to be the bus route I would take from my apartment in Weehawken, NJ to Port Authority in New York City. I would like to be able to have the bus route than reverse and go from NYC to New Jersey. Stylewise, I also plan to update the icons to a different style.
